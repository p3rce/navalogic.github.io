                    <h3>Entrepreneur, Business Consultant and Founder of Navalogic</h3>
                    
                    <p>Ganesh Navaratnarjah was the original founder of Navalogic and has over 20 years of business consulting experience.

                    <p>Ganesh's 'self-starter' mentality led to the creation of the NavaCup initiative. The annual golf tournament raises funds for at risk youth; and provides them with laptops to succeed in their studies (navacup.org). Bridging the digital divide has always been one of Ganesh's goals. To date, NavaCup has donated close to 400 laptops to at risk youth where 95%+ have gone on to post secondary education.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ganesh is also the president of the executive board of the Boys and Girls Clubs of East Scarborough (BGCES). He prides himself on giving back to the community. In addition to the NavaCup & the BGCES, Ganesh has volunteered time in Ghana (west Africa) as well as Tanzania; to most recently teach business at a school dedicated to educate and empower women. "You get by giving back" is a key mantra that Navalogic will always stand for.</p>
